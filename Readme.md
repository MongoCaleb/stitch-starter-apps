# MongoDb Android Starter Apps
Starter projects for working with MongoDB Mobile &amp;
[Stitch](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/) on mobile devices.

At MongoDB World 2018, Mongo announced the beta of 
[MongoDB Mobile](https://www.mongodb.com/use-cases/mobile), which 
enables you to use Mongo on your Android and iOS devices. This starter 
app provides a way to get up and running quickly (with zero config), and 
then either customize it or steal the code for your own projects.

# Requirements
For a list of platforms supported by MongoDB Mobile, see the
[MongoDB Mobile docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/mongodb/mobile/mobile-overview/).

# Getting Started
Check out the Readme file in the subfolder for the language/platform you 
want to use.
